# FaceMaskDetection
Build a face mask detection model with Yolov5

In this pandemic, we can use this type of models and install it in AI cameras to detect and allow person's who are wearing masks to enter a office campus, a shop or anywhere

This model used YoloV5 for classification and LabelImg for annotation tool.

2. Download the Annotation LabelImg. Use your own image datasets and create the annotation with this exe.
3. Use the MasDetection Model Generation to create the model. It is created using Google Colab.
4. Put it in the YoloV5 model directory
5. Use the VideoCapture python script to run from command line
